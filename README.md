- 👋 Hi, I’m @EllieKirkner.
- 👀 I’m interested in...video game theory, GBL practices, D&D, and learning a little bit about absolutely everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning...how to build my own 10th century hurdy gurdy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate...sometime in the future. Not taking on additional projects until I'm out of grad school.
- 📫 How to reach me...put a good cup of espresso under a box trap at dawn and wait patiently.

Thanks for reading, and stay human.
