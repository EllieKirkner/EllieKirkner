- 👋 Hi, I’m @EllieKirkner.
- 👀 I’m interested in...narrative game design, video game theory, GBL practices, D&D, and learning a little bit about absolutely everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning...how to build my own 10th century hurdy gurdy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate...on inventive games that explore emergent storytelling.
- 📫 How to reach me...put espresso under a box trap at dawn and wait patiently. Or drop me a line @EllieTsangKirkner on Bluesky.

Thanks for reading, and stay human.
